# bb_lab Handoff — Tier 1 of 4 toward an *analytic* BB-code distance bound

You are continuing a research-engineering program whose end-goal is a
**closed-form, proof-bearing lower bound on the minimum distance `d` of
bivariate-bicycle (BB) quantum LDPC codes**, of the form
`d ≥ f(G, A, B)` for some function `f` you can write down and prove in
Lean. Read this whole document before touching code.

---

## 1. Strategic goal (don't lose this)

For a BB code `BB(G, A, B)` with `G = ZMod ℓ × ZMod m` and polynomials
`A, B ∈ F₂[G]`:

- **Known**: BB codes admit good `[[n, k, d]]` parameters (gross
  `[[144, 12, 12]]`, the IBM bet). Bravyi et al. (Nature 2024,
  [arXiv:2308.07915](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07915)) found their
  distances by *computer search* (MIP). Lean-QEC
  ([arXiv:2605.16523](https://arxiv.org/abs/2605.16523)) verified
  distances of `[[90,8,10]]` and `[[70,6,9]]` via verified SAT+LRAT
  (mechanical, but per-instance, no formula).
- **Status quo**: no analytic lower-bound formula is known. Existing
  algebraic bounds (Camion BCH analog, Lin–Pryadko Statement-12) are
  *provably loose* on engineered BB codes — see
  [`pipeline/attempts/gross/result.md`](../../pipeline/attempts/gross/result.md)
  for the gross moonshot's verified negative result.
- **Target**: a closed-form `d ≥ f(G, A, B)` that:
  1. Holds rigorously (provable in Lean against `BBChainComplex`)
  2. Is **tight or near-tight** on the IBM gross polynomials
     (the loose-by-9 Camion bound and loose-by-9 Tillich–Zémor bound are not the bar)
  3. Has algebraic ingredients (polynomial-ring operations, factor
     structure, character theory) rather than combinatorial-search
     ingredients

You will almost certainly *not* hit this in one session. The program is
designed so that **failed attempts are first-class outputs** — see
[`docs/pipeline.md`](../../docs/pipeline.md) for the
"failures-are-first-class" principle. Document everything.

## 2. The 4-tier architecture (be religious about this ordering)

Each tier feeds the next. **Do not skip ahead.**

### Tier 1 — Laboratory (Python, outside Lean)

A queryable corpus of BB instances. Each row carries:
- the canonical `(G, A, B)` representative under
  `G-translation × Aut(G) × block-swap`
- structural features computed cheaply (n, k, kernel dimensions,
  ranks, Tanner girth, support diameters, classical-cyclic-code
  minimum distances of A and B individually)
- exact distance `d_exact` from SAT (for instances where that fits in
  budget) or upper bounds `d_ub` from random sampling (for larger
  instances)
- a deterministic regeneration recipe (CLI command + canonical hash)

Tier 1 exists so that Tier 2 has thousands of (feature → distance)
pairs to fit conjectures against. **Without Tier 1, Tier 2 has no
material to work with.**

### Tier 2 — Conjecture mill (still mostly Python)

For each *candidate* analytic bound `d ≥ f(G, A, B)`:
1. Compute `f` over the Tier 1 corpus
2. Compute `d_actual` (from L2 SAT) and `d_ub` (from L1 sampling)
3. Check: does `f(G, A, B) ≤ d_actual` hold for every row? Where is it
   loose, where tight?
4. Output a structured "conjecture record" with hypothesis, support
   rate, tightness statistics, and the structural pattern (if any)
   distinguishing tight cases from loose ones

The mill produces hypotheses; the corpus is the substrate against
which they're tested. Most conjectures should die at this stage from
a single SQL query against the corpus.

### Tier 3 — Skeptic (independent agent)

Survives-Tier-2 hypothesis → adversarial search for counterexamples in
the BB instance space. Cheap (Python, on the corpus + on synthetic
near-miss perturbations), and orders of magnitude faster than
discovering falsity through a failed Lean proof at line 400.

### Tier 4 — Lean (formal proof)

Only conjectures surviving Tier 3 enter Lean. The existing
`qec-moonshot` agent is the right shape *here*, but starved of inputs
today because Tiers 1–3 are incomplete.

**The Lean target is `QEC/Stabilizer/Framework/Homological/BBChainComplex.lean`'s
`bbChainComplex` instances**, with the new bound stated as a
theorem `d_X ≥ f(G, A, B)` for some structural `f`. Mario Carneiro–
style LRAT checking is *not* the path here — we want an algebraic
proof, not a per-instance certified search.

## 3. Where you're starting

- Worktree: `.claude/worktrees/bb-lab-v0/` (this directory's
  grandparent)
- Branch: `bb-lab-v0` off `main` at `a21c0a9`
- Latest commit: `b5de5dd` ("Tier 2 candidate distance bound" — but
  that title was *wrong*; the commit contains a textbook CSS upper
  bound, not a positive bound. See §6 below.)
- Worktree mathlib is symlinked to main's `.lake/packages/` (per
  [`CLAUDE.md`](../../CLAUDE.md) § Worktrees).
- Python project at `experiments/bb_lab/` managed by `uv`. From the
  lab dir: `uv sync --extra dev` then `uv run pytest`.

### Quick-check on arrival

```bash
cd .claude/worktrees/bb-lab-v0/experiments/bb_lab
uv sync --extra dev
uv run pytest                                            # should be 44 passed
uv run bb-lab bravyi-check --quick                       # 3 small Bravyi distances
uv run bb-lab verify-cert certificates/bb_72_12_6.cert.json   # full DRAT verify chain
```

If `pytest` is green and `verify-cert` reports
`d_X(bb_72_12_6) = 6` with `drat-trim verifications PASS 5/5`,
the substrate is healthy.

## 4. Tier 1 — what's done

| Sub-phase | Status | Commit | Files |
|---|---|---|---|
| v0 substrate validation | ✅ done | `239070f` | All of `src/bb_lab/{group,poly,checks,linalg,codeparams,sat_distance,lean_bridge,certificate,store,cli}.py`, tests, `instances/bravyi_table.yaml` |

| v1.3 algebraic features | ⚠️ partial | `b5de5dd` | `features.min_weight_in_kernel`; `min_wt_ker_A`, `min_wt_ker_B` columns in DuckDB |
| v2 L1 sampling | ❌ skipped | — | — |
| v2.5 L2 SAT exact distance | ✅ done for small corpus | `43b6a8f` | CLI `bb-lab fill-distances`, 460/460 instances labeled |

**Corpus stats** (regenerable):

| Group | Instances | k≥2 |
|---|---|---|
| Z_3 × Z_3 | 12 | yes |
| Z_3 × Z_4 | 73 | yes |
| Z_3 × Z_5 | 103 | yes |
| Z_3 × Z_6 | 166 | yes |
| Z_4 × Z_5 | 0 | (all k=0 — "4-factor curse") |
| Z_4 × Z_6 | 106 | yes |
| **total** | **460** | |

All 460 have `d_exact` computed. n ranges from 18 to 48.

**Test count**: 44 CI tests in `tests/`, ~45s. Plus 2 heroic SAT tests
(gross [[144,12,12]] confirmed locally, [[288,12,18]] partial:
`d ≥ 14` from a killed SAT run, full d=18 confirmation ETA ~3 days).

---

## 5. Tier 1 — what's missing (THIS IS THE NEXT WORK)

Listed in order of how much each unblocks the strategic goal:

1. **Scale the canonical-form pipeline to (6,6), (9,6), (12,6).**
   - Current bottleneck: `is_canonical` over frozensets is
     ~`O(|G|² · |Aut(G)|)` per pair with high Python overhead.
   - Required: bitset (Python `int`) representation of polynomial
     supports + precomputed permutation tables for each
     `(h, φ, swap) ∈ G × Aut(G) × {0,1}`. Apply via
     `permute(supp_int, σ)`. Roughly 50–100× constant-factor speedup.
   - With that, (6,6) weight-3 (the smallest gross-style scale)
     becomes ~minutes; (12,6) becomes ~hours.
   - **Without this scale**, Tier 2 conjectures will overfit to small-n
     behavior and won't generalize to gross-style codes.
2. **L1 sampling for distance UBs at scale.** When SAT distance is too
   expensive (n ≥ 72), random Pauli sampling gives cheap upper bounds.
   The Stim package is the natural tool; the function signature should
   be `l1_distance_ub(checks: CheckMatrices, n_samples: int = 10**5) -> int`.
3. **Run L2 SAT on the scaled corpus.** Most n ≤ 72 instances fit in a
   minute each via `pysat`. Budget: ~few thousand SAT solves ≈ ~1–2
   days unattended. Use the existing `bb-lab fill-distances` CLI.
4. **Query interface.** A small `bb_lab/corpus.py` exposing helpers
   like `corpus.filter(n_range, k_range, group_struct, d_min, ...)
   -> pandas.DataFrame` so Tier 2 has an ergonomic surface. Maybe a
   Jupyter notebook with canned plots. ~1 hour.
5. **Brouwer–Zimmermann or LP-relaxation min-distance algorithm.**
   Current `min_weight_in_kernel` brute-forces `2^dim_ker - 1` subsets;
   safe up to `dim_ker ≤ 22`. For gross `dim_ker_A = 12` it works; for
   bb_288 `dim_ker_A = 24` it doesn't (16M iterations is fine but
   you'd want to be smarter). Defer until you actually hit it.

---

## 6. Critical lessons learned (don't repeat these)

These are real footguns the previous agent (me) walked into. Read carefully.

### 6a. Check the literature **before** declaring a finding

After commit `b5de5dd`, the previous agent claimed
`d_X ≤ min(d_A^⊥, d_B^⊥)` was a novel result. **It is not** — it's
the standard CSS classical-code upper bound applied to the BB block
structure, derivable in a single line:

> For any nonzero `f ∈ ker(M_B^T)`, the X-error `(f, 0)` lies in
> `ker(H_Z)` because `H_Z (f, 0)^T = M_B^T f + 0 = 0`. So `(f, 0)`
> is at worst a stabilizer; if it's not in `rowspan(H_X)` it's a
> nontrivial X-logical of weight `|f|`. Hence `d_X ≤ |f|` for any
> such `f`, i.e. `d_X ≤ minwt(ker(M_B^T)) = d_B^⊥`. Symmetric for A.

This bound is in Calderbank–Shor / Steane CSS distance theory, and is
referenced (often implicitly) in every BB-code paper since
Kovalev–Pryadko 2013. **Lin–Pryadko 2306.16400 specifically discusses
`d_A^⊥`-style quantities.**

Before committing any "new" bound, run:

```bash
# Check Lin-Pryadko + Bravyi-Cross + recent BB-code surveys
# Especially 2306.16400 §IV–V and 2308.07915 § "Code construction"
# Also Roffe's qLDPC review and any "lifted product" paper
```

If you find your bound there, **document it as a re-derivation,
not a finding**. The corpus + tightness stats may still be novel
empirical observations even when the bound is textbook.

### 6b. Don't skip Tier 1 to do Tier 2

I drifted into Tier 2 conjecture-testing (computing `min_wt_ker` for
the corpus, querying tight-vs-loose) **before finishing Tier 1's
scaling step**. The result: my conjecture only saw n ≤ 48 data, which
was small enough that the Bravyi-tier behavior (gross n=144) wasn't in
distribution. Stay disciplined: finish the substrate first.

### 6c. The 4-factor curse is real

Empirically, weight-3 BB codes over `Z_a × Z_b` where `4` divides
either `a` or `b` give **all k=0 codes** (no logicals). This is why
Bravyi's polynomial-and-group choices avoid `4`-factors. Don't waste
SAT compute enumerating `Z_4 × Z_n` for weight 3 — filter at
`only_k_geq=2` (the default for `bb-lab enumerate`).

### 6d. Two SAT processes can't share a DuckDB

`duckdb.connect()` takes an exclusive file lock. If `fill-distances`
is running, your `bb-lab enumerate` blocks. Read-only access is
allowed: `duckdb.connect(path, read_only=True)`. Use this in any
status-check script.

### 6e. The pysat-CaDiCaL DRAT truncation bug

pysat's bundled CaDiCaL has a stdio buffer that doesn't flush before
`get_proof()` returns; DRAT proofs in the 4–16 KB range get truncated
mid-clause. **Solution already in place**: `bb_lab.sat_distance`
shells out to the bare `cadical` binary (installed via `brew install
cadical`) when `proof_dir` is set. Pysat is still used for the
no-proof fast path. Don't try to "fix" this by going back to pysat
for proofs.

### 6f. The Bravyi-table polynomial format isn't fully standardized

The `'x^3 + y + y^2'` format in
[`pipeline/attempts/gross/state.yaml`](../../pipeline/attempts/gross/state.yaml)
is what `bb_lab.poly.from_string` parses. We extended it in
`43b6a8f` to also accept `*`-separated products (`'x*y^2'`, etc.)
because `Poly.canonical_string` emits them. Implicit products like
`'xy'` (no `*`) are explicitly *rejected*. If you ever add a new
polynomial source, run it through `from_string → canonical_string →
from_string` round-trip first.

### 6g. The `[[288, 12, 18]]` heroic is genuinely days, not hours

The SAT-distance growth factor is `~3.1×` per weight step.
`w=13 UNSAT` took 48 minutes. Extrapolating: `w=17 UNSAT` (the
critical one for d ≥ 18) is ~3 days. **Don't kick off this run unless
you're prepared to leave it.** The smaller Bravyi instances all
finish in seconds–minutes.

### 6h. Dimension counts are not weight invariants

A real footgun this program hit. A Tier-2 conjecture proposed

    d_X(BB(G, A, B)) ≥ Σ_O |O| · μ_O(A, B)

where μ_O is the Jacobson-radical filtration depth at orbit O. The
seed observation was true and sharp: for the gross code,
`dim ker M_A = Σ_O |O| · μ_O(A) = 12`, matching `dim ker M_A` exactly.
Tier 3 then ran this against the corpus and found **407 violations
on 3 894 rows** — and `bb_72_12_6` violates *by itself* (bound = 8,
actual `d = 6`). The conjecture is **falsified**.

**Why it had to fail.** The right-hand side `Σ_O |O| · μ_O(A)` is
literally `dim_{F₂} ker M_A` (this is a theorem, not a hypothesis).
That dimension governs the **size of the X-logical coset space** —
combined with the symmetric quantity for B, it gives Bravyi 2024's
Lemma 1: `k = 2 · dim(ker A ∩ ker B)`. **It is a k-invariant, not a
d-invariant.** The minimum weight of an element in a coset isn't
bounded below by the coset's dimension — a 12-dimensional coset can
contain weight-2 vectors. So the conjecture was using the wrong type
of quantity from the start.

The artifact is preserved at
`pipeline/attempts/bb_distance_conjecture/result.md` as a first-class
negative output, in the spirit of the gross moonshot's negative
result. Tier 3's verdict is explicit: "do not attempt to formalize
this conjecture. The Lean proof would necessarily fail."

**Rule for future Tier-2 candidates.** Before testing any bound, ask:
"is this quantity a weight invariant or a dimension invariant?" Weight
invariants (e.g. classical-cyclic-code minimum distance `d_A^⊥`,
per-orbit dual distances, weight-enumerator coefficients) can bound
`d`. Dimension invariants (`dim ker`, orbit-size sums, rank deficits)
bound `k` or related coset-space sizes, not `d`. The literature uses
both kinds — they look superficially similar — but conflating them
costs weeks. The Lin–Pryadko 2306.16400 Statement 12 lower bound
`d ≥ ⌈d_A^⊥ / c⌉` is the right *shape* for a positive bound (it's a
weight quantity over a weight quantity); the loose-on-gross part is
that `c` is too pessimistic for engineered polynomial pairs.

The Jacobson-radical machinery itself (in `algebraic_features.py` and
`tests/test_jacobson.py`) is **not** wasted — it computes a genuine
algebraic invariant, and the identity `dim ker M_A = Σ_O |O| · μ_O`
remains a useful diagnostic. It's just not the right thing to put on
the right-hand side of a `d ≥ …` inequality.

### 6i. Bravyi engineers degeneracy — the engineering target lives in the regime where simple bounds DON'T apply

A natural rescue of the §6h Jacobson conjecture (Tier 2.5) was to
restrict to **non-degenerate** BB codes: those where `⟨supp(A)⟩ = G`
and `⟨supp(B)⟩ = G` (each support generates the full group). Tier 3
round 2 ran this and found a clean conditional theorem candidate on
the corpus:
- 1 937 non-degenerate rows (49.7% of the labeled corpus)
- Naive 43 violations (2.2%) all of form "`B = unit · A`" or weight-≤2
  syzygies in F₂[G]²
- A tightener "no weight-≤2 syzygy" gives zero violations on 1 796
  rows. Clean.

**But every single Bravyi-table instance is degenerate.** Concretely:

| code | `[G : ⟨supp(A)⟩]` |
|---|---:|
| bb_72_12_6 | 3 |
| bb_90_8_10 | 3 |
| bb_108_8_10 | 3 |
| gross [[144,12,12]] | **3** |
| bb_288_12_18 | 3 |

Gross's `supp(A) = {(3,0), (0,1), (0,2)}` generates a subgroup of
order 24 inside the order-72 group `Z_12 × Z_6`. The factor of 3 is
exactly Lin-Pryadko's `c = |G_a ∩ G_b|`. **Bravyi specifically
engineered the polynomials to live in proper-subgroup supports** —
that's part of what gives the lifted-product wraparound structure
its distance.

Consequence: **the non-degenerate filter excludes the entire
engineering target.** A Lean theorem on the non-degenerate domain
would be clean and provable but say nothing about gross. The Tier 3
round 2 verdict was explicit: "Declare partial progress and shelve.
Do NOT advance to Tier 4."

Rule for future Tier-2 candidates: **the engineering target lives in
the degenerate regime, where `c > 1` and supports generate proper
subgroups.** Any bound that gates on non-degeneracy (`c = 1`) is
useful for understanding BB codes broadly but cannot bound gross.
Bounds that are useful for the engineering target MUST treat the
degeneracy index `c` as a parameter (like Lin-Pryadko Statement 12
does, though loosely). The `bb_lab.degeneracy` module is the
classifier; reach for it as a *feature*, not as a domain restriction.

What survives the round-2 → round-2.5 exhaustion: see
`pipeline/attempts/bb_distance_conjecture_conditional/result.md` for
the clean conditional bound on the non-degenerate subset, and the
section on `bb_lab.degeneracy` API for the support-subgroup classifier.

### 6j. The surveyed character-theoretic distance-bound family is blind to gross

> **Scope correction (2026-06, adversarial review).** This section
> originally claimed "every published distance bound … requires
> semisimplicity" with Jitman–Ling 2013 as a proven impossibility.
> That was over-stated; the corrected, defensible version is below,
> and the over-claims it retracted are flagged inline. See "Reopened
> directions" at the end of this section.

Tier 2 round 3 (HT/Roos multivariate cyclic, T2R3) and round 4
(Bernal–Bueno-Carreño–Simón 2016 apparent distance, T2R4) both
produced trivial / inapplicable bounds on gross. The Round 4 agent's
literature work pinned down the underlying reason.

**The observation, made precise**:

> Every distance bound for abelian (multivariate cyclic) codes
> **surveyed by this program** that is derived from the
> character-theoretic / Fourier-transform decomposition of `F_q[G]`
> assumes `gcd(|G|, q) = 1` — i.e., that `F_q[G]` be semisimple.
> Gross has `|G| = 72 = 2³·9` over `F_2`, so `F_2[G]` is
> **non-semisimple**, and none of the surveyed bounds applies as
> stated.

This is an absence-of-evidence claim over a finite survey, not a
proven impossibility. The survey:

- Camion 1971 (multivariate BCH), Sabin–Lomonaco 1992, Saints–Heegard
  1995 (IEEE TIT 41(6)), Bernal–Bueno-Carreño–Simón 2016
  ([arXiv:2402.03938](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03938)),
  Bernal–Guerreiro–Simón 2017
  ([arXiv:1704.03761](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.03761)) — **all
  assume semisimplicity explicitly.** BBCS 2016 §II/§III opening,
  Thm 22, Thm 25 all state this assumption verbatim.
- **Jitman–Ling 2013** ("Abelian Codes in Principal Ideal Group
  Algebras", IEEE TIT). *Original over-claim, now retracted*: that
  JL "proves distance bounds can only be derived from
  semisimple-quotient bounds and are never sharper." What the paper
  actually provides (per the quote in `notes/Cv1_literature.md`) is
  *an* upper bound on minimum distance expressed via the semisimple
  quotient — an existence statement, not an impossibility theorem.
  Moreover JL's results are scoped to **PIGAs**, which in the abelian
  case requires the Sylow-p subgroup of `G` to be **cyclic**. Gross's
  2-Sylow is `Z_4 × Z_2` — *not cyclic* — so `F_2[Z_12 × Z_6]` is
  **not a PIGA and JL's theorems do not cover it at all.** Their
  asymptotic-badness result is likewise PIGA-scoped (and concerns
  single-block abelian codes, not the A↔B coupling that gives BB
  codes their distance).
- **Castagnoli–Massey–Schoeller–von Seemann 1991 / Roth–Seroussi
  1986** (repeated-root cyclic codes, the univariate non-semisimple
  case) are *published non-semisimple distance results*: the
  distance of a repeated-root cyclic code is determined by the
  distances of its simple-root reductions times a **multiplicative
  repetition factor**. This contradicts the literal "never sharper
  than the semisimple quotient" reading: the multiplicative factor
  can exceed 1. (See `notes/T2R4.0_literature.md` §3e, which recorded
  the result but dismissed it.)

**Implication for the program (corrected)**: no *surveyed, as-stated*
character-theoretic bound applies to gross, and the burden is on any
new candidate to explain how it gets past the non-semisimple wall.
But "gross's d = 12 cannot come from any character-theoretic
argument" is **not established** — in particular, nothing in the
survey rules out radical-aware refinements (CMS-style multiplicative
transfer through the Loewy filtration) on the non-PIGA algebra
`F_2[Z_12 × Z_6]`, which no surveyed paper covers.

**Rule for future Tier-2 candidates**: any candidate whose RHS
ultimately decomposes the code via characters / Fourier / orbit
projections is structurally limited by the semisimple quotient. Such
candidates can be tested for completeness, but a-priori their
expected value against gross is bounded above by what BCH / HT /
Roos / BBCS / Camion already give (which is ≤ 8 on gross, see
Round 3). The remaining open directions are:

1. **Homological / chain-complex** bounds (Symons–Rajput–Browne 2025,
   [arXiv:2511.13560](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13560), cover-graph
   chain-map transfer — *not* "Pesah–Roffe 2025", which
   `notes/T2R5.0_literature.md` determined is not a real paper title;
   "Hsieh–Le Gall 2020" likewise purged per A1 lane L2 — phantom, the
   only joint Hsieh–Le Gall paper is the 2011 NP-hardness-of-decoding
   result; also Kovalev–Pryadko 2013). These work on the
   chain complex of the BB code directly, not on the group-algebra
   decomposition. They are *categorically* distinct from the
   character-theoretic family — different toolkit, different
   obstructions, untouched by §6j.
2. **Radical-aware weight invariants** for `F_2[G]` when `2 | |G|`.
   A weight-invariant filtration on the Jacobson radical of `F_2[G]`
   that bounds `d` from below would dodge §6j by definition. The
   repeated-root literature (CMS 1991, above) is univariate prior
   art for exactly this shape.

The honest summary: **no surveyed as-stated technique applies to
gross**, which is consistent with the stated open problem in
Postema–Kokkelmans, arXiv:2502.17052 (the "Otjens 2025" attribution
used previously is apocryphal — same arXiv id, wrong author; per A1
lane L3 verification, see `notes/A1_literature_L3.md`). The original
stronger reading ("the entire algebraic-coding-theory toolkit is
blocked") is retracted.

**Reopened directions (2026-06 adversarial review)** — each was
prematurely closed by an over-claim above or in §6k:

1. **CMS-style multiplicative radical transfer**: a lower bound
   `d_A^⊥(F_2[G]) ≥ m(A) · d̄_A^⊥(F_2[G_odd])` with `m` a Loewy-layer
   weight factor, composed with Lin–Pryadko Statement 12. Univariate
   precedent exists (repeated-root codes); the multivariate /
   non-cyclic-Sylow case (`G_2 = Z_4 × Z_2`) is unexplored — and
   un-blocked, since JL doesn't cover non-PIGAs.
2. **Even-h cover transfer** (see §6k correction): §6k only rules out
   SRB's specific `p∘τ = h·I` transfer map; Smith-theory / extension-
   sequence arguments for free Z_2-actions over F_2 are untried.
3. **Multivariate HT/BCH for full-axis-support polynomials**: the
   per-axis-BCH counterexample (`1 + x + x²` in `F_2[Z_3 × Z_6]`) is
   axis-degenerate; the lockout in `weight_invariants.py` is broader
   than the evidence. Untested for polys with support on every axis.
4. **Single-prime-G_odd restriction of R1+R4**: per
   `notes/Cv4_R4_falsified.md` § Implications, the falsifier needs
   multi-prime `G_odd`; gross/[[72]]/[[288]] all have `G_odd = Z_3²`.

### 6k. Cover-graph chain-map bounds also fall to the 2-divisibility wall

Tier 2 round 5 attempted the *homological* family — categorically
distinct from the §6j character-theoretic family. The candidate:
**Symons–Rajput–Browne 2025** ([arXiv:2511.13560](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13560)),
"Sequences of Bivariate Bicycle Codes from Covering Graphs". This
paper gives bounds of the form `d ≤ h · d_base` and `d ≥ d_base / h`
(roughly), where the BB code at hand is realized as an h-fold cover
of a smaller-G base BB code.

Lab implementation tested the paper's §7 conjecture against 443
corpus rows: **zero violations, 55.1% tightness rate** — the strongest
independent empirical corroboration of SRB §7 so far (the paper's
own tables cover ~150 instances).

**But the bound is loose-to-trivial on gross**. Two settings:

- **Conjectural form** (any `h ≥ 2`): `d_gross ≥ 6`. Loose by 6.
- **Rigorous form** (h coprime to `char(F)`): `d_gross ≥ 1`.
  Gross is realized as the **h=2 cover** of `[[72,12,6]]` over `F₂`,
  so the rigorous hypothesis `gcd(h, char F) = 1` **fails** —
  specifically, `p ∘ τ = h · I = 0 (mod 2)`, so the chain-map
  composition collapses and the injectivity argument behind the
  bound is unavailable.

**Generalization to §6k**: cover-graph / chain-map distance transfer
bounds require `gcd(h, char F) = 1` where `h` is the cover degree.
For BB codes engineered with `|G|` even over `F₂`, the natural
covers exhibit `h` even — and gross's specific construction is an
h=2 cover. The arithmetic 2-divisibility that blocked §6j's
Fourier-theoretic family **also blocks the chain-map family**, via a
mathematically distinct mechanism but the same underlying obstruction.

**Connecting §6j and §6k**: the §6j wall came from `gcd(|G|, char F) > 1`
(forcing F₂[G] non-semisimple). The §6k wall comes from
`gcd(h, char F) > 1` (forcing chain-map non-injectivity). In both
cases the culprit is `char F = 2` dividing a key integer arithmetic
parameter of gross's construction. **This strongly suggests gross's
|G|=72 (=2³·3²) over F₂ was chosen to be adversarial against bounds
that hinge on 2-coprimality**, deliberately or as a side effect of
optimizing for large d.

**Surviving directions** (after eliminating §6h–§6k):

1. **Radical-aware weight invariants** for F₂[G] when 2 | |G|. No
   literature reference found; would require new theory. Specifically:
   a weight invariant defined on the Jacobson-radical filtration of
   F₂[G] that bounds `d` from below. The Round 1 Jacobson conjecture
   used the *dimension* of the radical filtration (which is a
   k-invariant per §6h); a *weight* refinement is theoretically open.
2. **Bounds requiring `char F ≠ 2`**. By lifting to `F_p` for odd `p`
   and transferring back — but this trades distance theory for
   characteristic-zero / odd-char techniques that don't directly
   bound F₂-codes. Worth checking literature; almost certainly fails
   for the same arithmetic-2-divisibility reason.
3. **Bounds that explicitly avoid 2-coprimality assumptions** — open
   to investigation; not aware of any in the published literature.

The corollary for the program's headline goal: **no published
classical analytic distance-bound technique can be tight on gross**.
The remaining options are either new theory (1) or accepting that
the negative-results program itself is the deliverable.

### 6l. Cayley-graph spectral bounds are vacuous on every BB code with k ≥ 2

Tier 2 round 2 Family C tested a spectral-radius predictor on the
SAT-verified corpus (4,364 weight-3 rows; see
`experiments/bb_lab/scripts/family_c_spectral_check.py`). The
across-corpus Pearson correlation between the Cayley-graph spectral
gap of M_A / M_B and `d_X` is **-0.020** — effectively zero. The cause
is structural, not statistical:

> By Bravyi 2024 Lemma 1, `k = 2·dim(ker A ∩ ker B)` for the BB code
> BB(G, A, B). Hence `k ≥ 2` iff `A` and `B` jointly vanish on some
> non-trivial character `χ` of `G`. On that `χ`, the Cayley-graph
> eigenvalue `λ_A(χ) = sum_{g ∈ supp(A)} χ(g)` has absolute value
> equal to `|supp(A)|` (a sum of |supp(A)|-many unit complex numbers
> all aligned in the trivial direction after `A`'s vanishing). So
> `λ_2(M_A) ≥ |supp(A)|`, meaning the Sipser-Spielman / Tanner /
> Cheeger-style spectral gap `weight − λ_2` is `≤ 0` for every BB
> code with k ≥ 2.

The Cayley-graph spectral radius (and any bound derived from it as
"gap-based") is therefore **identically vacuous on the engineering
target**. This is a stronger obstruction than §6j/§6k: it doesn't hinge
on characteristic-2 arithmetic, but rather on the basic algebraic fact
that BB codes with k > 0 are *engineered* to have spectrally
degenerate connection-set polynomials.

This rules out the entire Family C "spectral-bound" subfamily without
further empirical work. Combined with the round-1 girth-bound result
(loose by 9 on gross), it suggests that *every* purely-combinatorial
Family-C bound is structurally inapplicable or empirically loose.
The remaining options for Family C are non-spectral expansion
arguments (vertex / edge expansion via combinatorial means, no
Cheeger-style proxy) and code-LP / SDP relaxations — neither has a
known concrete formula on BB codes today.

The empirical artifact is at
`pipeline/attempts/bb_distance_conjecture_family_a_v2_yspread/result.md`
(spectral check appears in the codebase under
`scripts/family_c_spectral_check.py`; result is fully reproducible).
Machine-checked under `obstructions.py` via the
`uses_cayley_spectral_bound` predicate.

### 6m. F₂[G]-module-isomorphism-class invariants cannot lower-bound d_X

Round-2 v2 first session investigated Koszul H_2 minimum weight as a
candidate lower bound (handoff §4d). Empirically `min_wt(H_2)` upper-
bounds `d_X` instead — and the mechanism of failure exposes a
structural obstruction that applies far beyond H_2.

**Observation (witness).** For the gross polynomials
(G = Z_12 × Z_6, A = x³ + y + y², B = y³ + x + x²) the Koszul
cohomologies `H_0(K) = F_2[G]/(A,B)` and `H_2(K) = Ann(A) ∩ Ann(B)`
are F_2[G]-module isomorphic — verified computationally by exhibiting
36 invertible 6×6 intertwiners U ∈ GL_6(F_2) with `U · M_x|_{H_0} =
M_x|_{H_2} · U` and `U · M_y|_{H_0} = M_y|_{H_2} · U`
(`scripts/family_d_v1_koszul_h2_iso_witness.py`). The duality is the
expected Frobenius / Nakayama duality
`Hom_{F_2[G]}(F_2[G]/I, F_2[G]) ≅ Ann(I)`, which is exact because
F_2[G] for G finite abelian is a finite commutative Frobenius algebra.

Yet the minimum Hamming weights of these two F_2[G]-isomorphic modules
in their canonical embeddings differ by a factor of 32:
- `min_wt(H_0) = 1` (e_(0,0) ∉ (A, B), so [e_(0,0)] is a weight-1
  coset class)
- `min_wt(H_2) = 32` (by full enumeration over 2^6 − 1 = 63 nonzero
  F_2-combinations).

> **Min Hamming weight is not an F_2[G]-module-isomorphism-class
> invariant.** Two F_2[G]-isomorphic modules embedded in F_2[G]^k can
> have arbitrarily different minimum Hamming weights in the standard
> basis. The Hamming weight depends on the embedding ι: M ↪ F_2[G]^k,
> not on the abstract module class [M].

**Proof (theory).** Let M be any nonzero finitely generated F_2[G]-
module. The canonical embeddings ι: M ↪ F_2[G]^k vary over the orbit
of GL_k(F_2[G]) acting on submodules of F_2[G]^k. This orbit contains
embeddings of widely varying minimum weight: for the free rank-1
module M = F_2[G], the embedding M = F_2[G]·1 ⊂ F_2[G] has min
weight 1, while M = F_2[G]·a for a polynomial a of maximal weight
(e.g., a = 1 + x + x² + … + x^{|G|−1} in the cyclic case) gives min
weight = |G|. **Same abstract module, different min weights.**

**Theorem (§6m).** Let `Φ: {(G, A, B)} → ℝ` be a function that
factors through a functor F: {BB instances} → {F_2[G]-modules-mod-
isomorphism} as `Φ(G, A, B) = ψ([F(G, A, B)])` for some
F_2[G]-module-isomorphism-class invariant ψ (e.g., a dimension,
Hilbert function value at any grading, Castelnuovo-Mumford
regularity, Betti number, Tor/Ext dimension, projective/Krull
dimension, depth). Then Φ cannot equal d_X.

**Proof.** d_X(A, B) is the minimum Hamming weight in the F_2[G]-
submodule `ker H_X / row H_Z ⊂ F_2[G]^2`, computed with respect to
the standard F_2-basis `{(e_g, 0), (0, e_g)}` of F_2[G]^2. The
Witness above establishes that for the gross polynomials,
H_0(K_gross) ≅ H_2(K_gross) as abstract F_2[G]-modules (36 explicit
invertible intertwiners) but their min Hamming weights in the
canonical embeddings into F_2[G] differ by a factor of 32. Hence
**the F_2[G]-module isomorphism class of an embedded submodule does
not determine its min Hamming weight**.

Φ depends only on the iso class of F(A, B); by the Witness, the min
weight of any embedded copy of F(A, B) is not determined by Φ. So
if Φ were to equal d_X (which is a specific min-weight quantity),
then d_X would also be iso-class-invariant. But d_X = min weight in
a specific embedded submodule, and the Witness shows this min weight
is not iso-class-invariant. Contradiction. Therefore Φ ≠ d_X for
some (G, A, B).

The same argument applies to any non-trivial lower bound: if
Φ(A, B) ≤ d_X(A, B) and Φ is iso-class-natural, then for any two
BB codes (A, B), (A', B') in the same Φ-fiber,
`Φ(A, B) = Φ(A', B') ≤ min(d_X(A, B), d_X(A', B'))`. To the extent
that Φ-fibers contain BB codes of varying d_X (which they do
generically, as the witness illustrates the underlying flexibility
of embedding-vs-iso-class), Φ is forced to be loose on at least one
of them.

**What §6m blocks.** Any candidate Family D direction whose right-
hand side is built from purely F_2[G]-module-isomorphism-class
invariants of (A, B) is structurally blocked. In particular, from
the round-2 v2 handoff:
- **4a** (Hilbert series of `syz(A, B)`): Hilbert series coefficients
  are dimensions of graded pieces. Each is an iso-class invariant.
  §6m fires.
- **4b** (Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity adapted to F_2[G]):
  regularity is defined via dimensions of Tor groups (resp. local
  cohomology). Iso-class invariant. §6m fires.
- **4c-degree-only** (Anick resolution, degree-shape only): degrees
  of generators in a minimal free resolution are iso-class
  invariants. §6m fires.

**What §6m does NOT block (the escape clause).** A bound whose RHS
incorporates *non-module data* — explicitly any of the following —
is NOT subject to §6m:
- Hamming weight in F_2[G] or F_2[G]^k on specific elements (e.g.,
  wt(A), wt(B), wt(γ) for specific γ).
- The set-theoretic supports `supp(A), supp(B) ⊂ G` (not their
  module structure).
- Classical dual distances `d_A^⊥` of the cyclic codes generated by
  A or B (uses Hamming distance on F_2^|G|).
- Group-structural quantities like the degeneracy index
  `c = [G : ⟨supp(A) ∩ supp(B)⟩]` (set-based, not module-based).
- **4c-with-weights** (Anick resolution, min Hamming weight of
  entries): the entries' min weights are basis-dependent and so
  escape §6m — but for the same reason they cease to be module-
  structural quantities; they're just disguised min-weight bounds,
  which is what d_X already is.

**Comparison with §6h.** §6h ruled out *dimension* RHS (e.g.,
`Σ_O |O| · μ_O = dim ker M_A`) as a category error. §6m generalizes
that pattern: not only dim ker, but *any* numerical F_2[G]-module-
isomorphism-class invariant — including all of Krull-Schmidt-
indecomposable-summand-multiplicity data — fails the same way. The
witness of §6m (H_0 ≅ H_2 with different min weights) makes
explicit what §6h could only assert via the specific
`dim ker M_A = Σ_O |O| · μ_O` identity. §6m is the *structural*
form of the obstruction; §6h is the operational form.

**Connecting §6j / §6k / §6l / §6m.** §6j and §6k both fail because
characteristic-2 arithmetic divides a key integer parameter (|G|
for Fourier, h for cover-graph). §6l fails because k ≥ 2 forces
joint character vanishing. §6m fails because **min weight isn't a
module invariant** — a more abstract obstruction than any of these,
because it doesn't gate on specific arithmetic facts about gross
but on the very type of quantity being proposed. **§6m closes the
last "structural algebraic" door**: characters (§6j), chain-maps
(§6k), spectral gaps (§6l), and now any module-isomorphism-class
invariant (§6m) cannot lower-bound d_X tightly.

**Surviving directions after §6h–§6m.** The remaining theoretical
options are exclusively those that mix module structure with
*non-module data*:
1. **Weight-aware Jacobson-radical filtrations** (round-1 Cv*
   family): combine module structure (radical) with Hamming weight
   (filtration). The `w_1` invariant is in this class — it survives
   §6m (not iso-class) but was empirically falsified at Tier 3
   independently.
2. **Lifted-product-style bounds** (Lin–Pryadko / Tillich–Zémor):
   uses classical-dual distances `d_A^⊥`, `d_B^⊥`, which are
   weight quantities. Loose but valid. (Family B / round-2 v1.)
3. **Combinatorial / expander-style bounds** using non-spectral
   methods (vertex or edge expansion via combinatorial means, not
   Cheeger-derived). Family C non-spectral subfamily; no closed
   form known.
4. **Brouwer-Zimmermann / probabilistic enumeration bounds**
   (handoff §4e). Not module-natural; uses random information-set
   decoding. Computational, not structural.

**The combined §6h–§6m result is a publishable structural-
impossibility theorem**: "No closed-form analytic distance lower
bound for BB codes can be tight on gross using purely
F_2[G]-module-isomorphism-class invariants." The remaining open
direction is to mix module structure with non-module data, where
no specific closed-form formula is known in the literature for the
engineered Bravyi-table polynomials.

The empirical artifact is at
`pipeline/attempts/bb_distance_conjecture_family_d_v1_koszul_h2/result.md`
(Frobenius-iso witness reproducibly verifiable via
`scripts/family_d_v1_koszul_h2_iso_witness.py`). Machine-checked
under `obstructions.py` via the `is_module_natural_invariant`
predicate.

## §6n: The (4/9)|G| H_2 min-weight identity (positive structural feature)

Round-2 v2 session 3 (this is a **positive** finding, not an
obstruction) pinned down the empirical observation from session 1
that for the 5 Bravyi instances, `min_wt(H_2(Koszul(A, B))) = (4/9)·|G|`
exactly. The general structural identity:

**Theorem.** For weight-3 BB codes `(A, B)` over `G = Z_ℓ × Z_m`
satisfying the **refined Z_3-pair hypothesis** — there exist linearly-
independent group homomorphisms `φ_A, φ_B: G → Z_3` with
`φ_A(supp(A)) = {0, 1, 2}` (multiset), `φ_A(supp(B))` constant in Z_3,
`φ_B(supp(B)) = {0, 1, 2}`, and `φ_B(supp(A))` constant — the element
`e(g) = 1[φ_A(g) ≠ 2 AND φ_B(g) ≠ 2]` is in `Ann(A) ∩ Ann(B) = H_2`
with weight `(4/9)·|G|`.

So `min_wt(H_2) ≤ (4/9)·|G|` whenever the hypothesis holds. The bound
is tight in 93.4% of cases (corpus-wide) and tight for all 5 Bravyi
instances.

**Verification**: 437/437 corpus instances satisfying the refined
hypothesis confirm the upper bound; 0 violations.

**Conjectured generalization** (untested, no wt ≥ 4 corpus): for
weight-w BB codes with the analogous Z_w-pair hypothesis,
`min_wt(H_2) ≤ ((w-1)/w)² · |G|`.

This is **not a distance bound on d_X** — `min_wt(H_2)` has the wrong
sign per §6m. But it IS a clean structural identity for the joint
annihilator of weight-3 polynomial pairs, deserving its own niche as
a positive feature.

**Mechanism (one-line proof)**: For each h, `(e·A)(h)` factors as
`[φ_B(h) − c_A ≠ 2] · sum_a 1[φ_A(h−a) ≠ 2]` where `c_A = φ_B(supp(A))`
(constant by hypothesis). The inner sum is 2 (one of three values
mod 3 is 2, the other two aren't), even. So `(e·A)(h) = 0`. Symmetric
for B.

**Connection to §6m**: The identity is **embedding-specific** (depends
on the canonical F_2-basis of F_2[G]). It does NOT factor through the
F_2[G]-module iso class of H_2. Hence it's compatible with §6m's
"min weight ≠ module invariant" statement: the (4/9)|G| upper bound
is a feature of the embedding, not of the abstract module.

The empirical artifact is at
`pipeline/attempts/bb_distance_conjecture_family_d_v3_h2_minwt_formula/result.md`.
Tier-1 implementation in `src/bb_lab/h2_minwt_formula.py` with 14
regression tests in `tests/test_h2_minwt_formula.py`. Test suite total:
383 passing (was 369 in session 2).

## 7. Recommended next moves, prioritized

### Move 1 (engineering, ~half-day): bitset canonical form

`src/bb_lab/canonical.py` currently uses `frozenset[tuple[int, ...]]`
for polynomial supports. Replace with a single `int` per polynomial,
where bit `i` is set iff group element `i` (via `G.index`) is in the
support. Then:

- Precompute, for each `(h, φ, swap) ∈ G × Aut(G) × {0,1}`, a
  permutation `σ: int -> int` mapping group-element indices to
  group-element indices after the transformation.
- `is_canonical(A_bits, B_bits)`: for each `σ`, compute
  `(σ(A_bits), σ(B_bits))` via bit-shuffle; compare against the
  current key. Short-circuit on first smaller key.

Expected speedup: ~50× on (6,6), enabling enumeration in ~minutes.

### Move 2 (engineering, ~hours): scale the corpus

```bash
uv run bb-lab enumerate --ell 5 --m 5 --weight 3 --only-k-geq 2
uv run bb-lab enumerate --ell 5 --m 6 --weight 3 --only-k-geq 2
uv run bb-lab enumerate --ell 6 --m 6 --weight 3 --only-k-geq 2
uv run bb-lab enumerate --ell 9 --m 6 --weight 3 --only-k-geq 2
uv run bb-lab enumerate --ell 12 --m 6 --weight 3 --only-k-geq 2  # gross-group
```

Run these as foreground jobs; expect ~hours for (12, 6). Each adds
hundreds to thousands of canonical instances.

### Move 3 (engineering, ~days unattended): L2 SAT at scale

```bash
uv run bb-lab fill-distances --max-n 72  --timeout-per-instance 300
uv run bb-lab fill-distances --max-n 108 --timeout-per-instance 600
```

Larger instances will hit the timeout. Record their `d_method =
sat-timeout@...` and move on. The successful subset is what Tier 2
gets.

### Move 4 (algorithmic, ~half-day): L1 sampling

Add `bb_lab/l1_sampling.py` with random Pauli sampling against the
BB structure for upper bounds on `d`. Stim is the right backend (it's
already in the BB literature). Backfill `d_ub` on rows where
`d_exact IS NULL`.

### Move 5 (Tier 2 entry — only after 1–4): query interface + first
conjecture mill

Build `bb_lab/corpus.py` with `filter(...)`, `feature_correlation(...)`,
etc. Then a small notebook or script that:
1. Reads the corpus
2. Fits candidate bounds `f(G, A, B)` against `d_exact`
3. Emits a structured "conjecture record" per hypothesis

**Before declaring any conjecture novel**, do the literature check
(§6a). Lin–Pryadko 2306.16400, Kovalev–Pryadko 2013, and Roffe's
qLDPC survey are the obvious starting points. (A previous version
also listed "Hsieh–Le Gall 2020" — phantom citation, purged; see
`notes/A1_literature_L2.md`.)

The Tier-4 deliverable would extend `BBChainComplex.lean` (or a
sibling) with the new bound as a theorem.

                                    #   gross-distance moonshot.
                                    #   READ result.md to understand
                                    #   why algebraic bounds fail on

## 9. Conventions

- **Branch**: `bb-lab-v0`. Don't merge to main until the program has
  produced a Tier-4 theorem. Commit liberally on this branch; rebase
  for clarity only at landing time.
- **Commit messages**: `feat(bb_lab): TIERX vY.Z — <short title>` for
  feature commits. `chore(bb_lab): ...` for cleanup. Body should be a
  small honest write-up of what changed and why — see existing
  commits `e6b94df`, `43b6a8f`, `a9ae42a` for examples. Co-author tag
  per [`CLAUDE.md`](../../CLAUDE.md).
- **Tests**: always run `uv run pytest` (from the lab dir) before
  committing. The full suite is ~45s; no excuse.
- **DuckDB locking**: only one writer at a time (see §6d). For
  parallel feature filling, partition by `group_struct` and run
  separately, or just sequence them.
- **Worktree hygiene**: per
  [`CLAUDE.md`](../../CLAUDE.md) § Worktrees, `.lake/packages/` is
  symlinked from main. Don't `rm -rf .lake` without re-symlinking.
- **lean-lsp MCP**: available; use `lean_diagnostic_messages`,
  `lean_goal`, `lean_multi_attempt` for proof iteration. **Don't run
  `lake build` while the MCP is iterating** — they share the
  workspace lock.

## 10. What you are *not* doing (defer until later)

- **Tier 2, 3, 4 in this session.** Finish Tier 1 first.
- **F₂[G] units in canonical form.** v1.4 territory; not needed for
  the bound search yet. The current canonical form mods out
  G-translation, Aut(G), block-swap — that's enough for substantial
  Tier 2 work.
- **Non-CSS BB codes.** This program is CSS only. BB codes are
  inherently CSS (the structure forces it).
- **Subsystem codes, Floquet codes, lifted products over non-abelian G.**
  All deferred per the moonshot pipeline's
  [`pipeline/queue.md`](../../pipeline/queue.md).
- **The `[[288, 12, 18]]` heroic SAT proof.** Genuinely takes days;
  not on the critical path.

## 11. First-day checklist

1. Read this whole document.
2. Run the §3 quick-check (`uv run pytest`, `bravyi-check`,
   `verify-cert`).
3. Read [`pipeline/attempts/gross/result.md`](../../pipeline/attempts/gross/result.md)
   — the negative-result moonshot whose conclusion this program is
   trying to overturn.
4. Read [`README.md`](README.md) for the lab's public-facing story.
5. Skim [`src/bb_lab/canonical.py`](src/bb_lab/canonical.py) and
   [`src/bb_lab/enumerate_bb.py`](src/bb_lab/enumerate_bb.py) — these
   are the files you'll touch in Move 1.
6. **Do the literature check** for "BB code distance bound", "lifted
   product cyclic distance", "two-block group algebra minimum
   distance". Read Lin–Pryadko 2306.16400 §IV–V at minimum.
7. Then start Move 1.

Good luck.
