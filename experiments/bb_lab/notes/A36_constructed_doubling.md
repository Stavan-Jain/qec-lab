# A36 — constructed doubling pairs: engineering q = k·d²/n > 13.5 covers by design

**Question.** A35 (sibling session, same day) searched the *stored* corpus
presentations of every exact-d base with `q_base > 6.75` and got a wall of
certified negatives: 42 certify runs, 0 hits, with a sharp anatomy — 9 runs
froze exactly at `d_base` and 11 stalled at `d_base + 2/+4`; **zero** even
reached the 2d − 2 deficit wall. This line attacks the same FOM target
(`q = k·d²/n > 13.5` via a certified doubling rung `[[n,k,d]] → [[2n,k,2d]]`,
which doubles q) from the *construction* side: doubling is
presentation-sensitive (A11 Entry 1 — every stored-form negative on the
Z₆×Z₆ engine frame flipped to d = 12 in an anchorable presentation), so
instead of testing the presentations the corpus happens to store, engineer
the presentation cell so the doubling template holds by design.

**Budget rule (hard, user-set, same as A35).** ≤ 5 min compute per code
(one certify() target), one fallback retry ≤ 15 min when 5 is infeasible,
nothing beyond 15. Cheap screens (rank checks, seam arithmetic, base-side
coset probes ≤ ~10 s) are screens, not certification, and are exempt.
Refusals are ledger verdicts (`REFUSED-BUDGET`), never silent.

**CPU contention note.** The A35 sibling ran certification batteries on
this same 10-core machine throughout this session; certify() calls here use
`threads = 4` (vs the front-end default 8) and wall times should be read
with that handicap in mind.

**Status: session 1, 2026-08-11.**

## 0. The design theory (what "by design" means)

A certified literal-lift doubling needs four template conditions
(extensibility doc §3, A11 §1); on odd-weight pairs the discriminating one
is condition 3's **safe floor** (A11 S2: `safe_floor_ok` sufficient-shaped
at 0/465 on the corpus, and the A35 refutation anatomy is 20/20 safe-floor
kills). The safe floor is a *base-side* quantity: for every kernel class
ζ ∈ ker ∂₂ ∖ 0, the seam-carry coset `t(ζ) + rowspace(S)` must have min
weight ≥ 2d (A14 Prop A14.1, A29 seam offsets, A30 coset-BZ).

The construction levers, in decreasing directness:

1. **Seam re-routing (Mode 1 — presentation orbits).** The seam offset
   `t(ζ) = carry(Ã·ζ̃, B̃·ζ̃)` depends on which monomial products cross the
   doubled-axis seam — exactly what doubled-axis translations of A and B
   change. The seam-relevant equivalence set per (code, axis) is
   **doubled-axis translations of A and B independently × diagonal unit
   automorphisms (x,y) → (x^u, y^v) × A↔B swap** (undoubled-axis
   translations are exact cover symmetries and cannot move seams —
   A14 §15). d(base), k, and ker ∂₂ are orbit-invariant; the seams and (R)
   are not. A11 Entry 1 (hit2/3/5 flips) and A14 §15 (bb_108, no rescue)
   are the two known outcomes of sweeping this orbit: the sweep decides
   which kind of code we have.
2. **(R) by construction.** k-preservation ⟺ (R) ⟺ `1+δ ∈ (A,B)` in the
   cover ring (A12). Checked per cell (lazy, on S0 survivors — an S0
   reject is a genuine coset element regardless of (R), A14 §16).
3. **Fresh enumeration (Mode 2, fallback).** If a code's whole orbit has a
   safe-floor ceiling < 2d (bb_108-style code-level obstruction), enumerate
   *new* (A,B) pairs on the same frame: k-gate by rank, screen seams first,
   establish d(base) exactly only for survivors. D1∧D2 difference-set
   structure (A5 Entry 15's discovery-sieve surprise) as an enumeration
   prior where compatible.
4. **Descent twists (Mode 3, second shot).** ~2^(wA+wB) sheet-twisted
   covers per extension class (A10); rescued hit2/hit5 historically.
   Solver-tier certificates only — noted as a tier difference.

Screens are tiered exactly like A14 §15, kills are sound at every tier
(each tier exhibits a genuine coset element below the floor):

- **T0 (free):** S0 raw seam minimum over all 2^κ − 1 kernel classes
  (κ = k/2); reject iff min |t| < 2d. Pure numpy seam arithmetic.
- **T0.5 (lazy):** k-gate (cover rank) on S0 survivors only.
- **T1 (cheap):** exact per-class coset minima by SAT ladder
  (CaDiCaL, cap 2d − 1, parity-stepped) — the A11 s3 probe at the
  right cap. Reject iff any class min < 2d.
- **T2 (the verdict oracle):** `bb_lab.doubling_certify.certify()` on the
  cover spec, budget-capped — certificate-tier CERTIFIED /
  DOUBLING-REFUTED / etc. Claim tier: **certified computational data, NOT
  kernel-checked Lean**; SAT/DRAT artifacts (Modes 3) are solver-tier.

## 1. Targets (inside the measured budget envelope)

A35 measured the generic front-end envelope on this machine:
(d_base ≤ 12 AND n ≲ 126 — but n = 126 at W = 22 already BUDGET-FINAL)
∪ (d_base ≤ 10 AND n ≲ 168). k = 16 refused (2^k cosets); k = 14 heavy.
Construction docket, ranked by q_cover × iteration cost (certify wall
times from the A35 ledger for the same points):

| # | base point | group | q_cover target | certify-refute wall | orbit cells/axis |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| T1 | [[126,12,10]] | Z₇×Z₉ | **[[252,12,20]] 19.05** | ~40 s | 3,528 |
| T2 | [[120,8,12]] | Z₆×Z₁₀ | **[[240,8,24]] 19.20** | ~410 s | 576/1600 |
| T2b | [[120,8,12]] | Z₅×Z₁₂ | **[[240,8,24]] 19.20** | ~420 s (y only) | 400/2304 |
| T3 | [[90,8,10]] | Z₁₅×Z₃ | [[180,8,20]] 17.78 | ~4 s | 7,200/144 |
| T4 | [[98,6,12]] | Z₇×Z₇ | [[196,6,24]] 17.63 | ~180 s | 3,528 |
| T5 | [[112,6,12]] | Z₇×Z₈ | [[224,6,24]] 15.43 | ~280 s | mid |
| T6 | [[84,6,10]] | Z₆×Z₇ | [[168,6,20]] 14.29 | ~4 s | small |

Excluded as already closed or out of envelope: bb_108 [[108,8,10]] Z₉×Z₆
(A14 §15/§16: presentation orbit + Z₁₈×Z₃ re-decomposition exhausted, no
SF-passing cell — code-level obstruction); [[144,8,12]], [[126,6,12]],
[[150,8,12]], [[162,8,12]], [[168,8/12/14,·]] d = 12 points (census
W = 22 at n ≥ 144, or BUDGET-FINAL measured by A35); [[180,16,10]]
(k = 16 refused); [[126,12,12–14]] Lane-D dreams (n = 126 at W = 22 is
past the envelope — theory route only). bb_90 [[90,8,10]] Z₁₅×Z₃ stored
forms are A14 §14-refuted but its presentation orbit was never swept —
T3 does it.

## 2. Controls (falsify-first)

Before any screen verdict is trusted:

- **Known-positive control:** the A30-certified [[180,4,10]] Z₁₅×Z₆ code
  (`A = 1+y+x`, `B = y⁴+x+x¹¹y²`, x-axis) must pass T0/T1 at floor 20.
- **Known-negative control:** bb_108 stored-y (exact d_safe = 14 per
  A17 §8) must be killed by T1 (and ideally T0).
- **A35 consistency:** the stored cells refuted by the sibling at my
  target points must be killed by T0/T1.
