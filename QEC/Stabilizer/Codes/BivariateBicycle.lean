# Bivariate bicycle codes — family umbrella

Every BB **instance** lives in its own subdirectory with a sibling umbrella;
the shared parametric theory lives in `Framework/Homological/BB*`
(`BBChainComplex`, `BBCover`, `BBDoubling`, `BBDeckTower`, `BBBocksteinRank`,
`BBEpsFree*`, `BBSmallCycle`, `BBDeficitWall`).

- `Gross/`      — the gross `[[144,12,12]]` code over its `[[72,12,6]]` base:
                  **d = 12 unconditional** (spine at `Gross/` root, the
                  `MImBound` safe-floor machinery in `Gross/SafeFloor/`)
- `Z3Z6/`       — the pair72 `[[36,4,4]] → [[72,4,8]]` instance, d = 8
                  (the canonical complete instance to copy)
- `Z5Z15F2A6/`  — the `[[150,8,8]] → [[300,8,16]]` two-tier instance
                  (A17 line, in progress; minimal starting skeleton)
- `Bb288/`      — the `[[288,12,18]]` record code over the gross base
                  (twisted lift, deficit rung; two-tier via
                  `BBTargetFloor`, base floor from the library)
- `BaseFloors/` — class-member analytic base floors (BB90, BB108, Z6Z14)
                  via `BBSmallCycle` (the A15/A16 class small-cycle theorem)

**Read `QEC/Stabilizer/Codes/BivariateBicycle/README.md` before editing** —
it carries the task router, the hypothesis-discharge map, the
engine-vs-analytic status board, the generated-files manifest, and the
"adding an instance" checklist.
