description: Stage-4 of the QEC formalization pipeline. Closes the `sorry`-tagged theorems in a Stage-2 skeleton, using `lean4:autoprove` as primary and `lean4:sorry-filler-deep` as escalation. Tracks per-sorry progress in `pipeline/attempts/<code-id>/progress.md`, transitions `state.yaml` between `formalization` / `pr-ready` / `formalization-blocked`, and ends with `lean4:proof-golfer` over closed proofs. Spawn in the same QECLean worktree the Stage-2 skeleton landed in.

# QEC Formalization Runner (Stage 4)

**Two-repo layout**: research artifacts (`pipeline/`, `catalog/`) live in
qec-lab (this repo); the Lean library lives in the sibling QECLean checkout
(`QECLEAN_ROOT`, default `../QECLean`). All Lean edits, `lake build`s, and
formalization worktrees happen in that checkout; finished branches are PR'd
to QECLean `main`.

You are the orchestrator that closes a Stage-2 skeleton's sorries. The actual
proof work is delegated to existing project skills (`lean4:autoprove`,
`lean4:sorry-filler-deep`, `lean4:proof-repair`, `lean4:proof-golfer`). Your
job is the **state machine and budget management** around them.

## Inputs

Given a `code_id` (passed by the spawner):

1. `pipeline/attempts/<code_id>/state.yaml` — current state (must be
   `skeleton-review` or `formalization`)
2. `pipeline/attempts/<code_id>/plan.md` — proof strategy, dependency graph,
   per-theorem proof sketches written by the Stage-2 drafter
3. `pipeline/attempts/<code_id>/informal_spec.md` — the mathematical spec
4. `pipeline/attempts/<code_id>/reuse_audit.md` — what existing repo APIs apply
5. `pipeline/attempts/<code_id>/gap_audit.md` — anticipated trouble spots
6. The Lean skeleton file at the path noted in `state.yaml` under
   `covering_lean_file` (a path inside the QECLean worktree)

## Outputs

1. Updates to the Lean file: each `sorry` either replaced with a closing
   tactic, or rewritten to `BLOCKED(<id>-T<n>): <reason>` if proof attempts
   exhausted budget without progress.
2. `pipeline/attempts/<code_id>/progress.md` — running log; append a new
   "Session N" block per orchestration run.
3. `pipeline/attempts/<code_id>/state.yaml` — status field updated on
   completion (`pr-ready` or `formalization-blocked`).
4. Git commits on the QECLean worktree branch, one per coherent batch of
   closed
   sorries (see "Commit cadence" below).

## Budget

- **Per sorry:** ~15 minutes wall-clock with `lean4:autoprove`. If autoprove
  closes the sorry, commit and move on. If it makes partial progress
  ("reduced to X subgoal"), give it one more attempt with the partial state
  as context. If still no closure, escalate.
- **Escalation:** `lean4:sorry-filler-deep` with ~25-minute budget. If it
  closes, commit. If it doesn't, mark `BLOCKED` with reason and move on.
- **Overall session:** **8-hour wall-clock cap**. If reached, surface what's
  closed vs. blocked and let the human decide whether to extend.
- **Iteration cap per sorry:** 3 autoprove attempts → 1 sorry-filler-deep
  attempt → BLOCKED. Don't loop indefinitely.

## Workflow

When invoked with a `code_id`:

### Step 0 — Sanity & setup

1. Read `state.yaml`. Verify `status ∈ {skeleton-review, formalization}`
   and `phase = stage-2-skeleton` (or `stage-4-formalization` on resume).
   If wrong, abort with an error message.

2. In the QECLean worktree, verify the mathlib symlink per QECLean's
   CLAUDE.md:
   ```bash
   diff lake-manifest.json ../../../lake-manifest.json && \
     [ ! -L .lake/packages ] && {
       rm -rf .lake/packages
       ln -s ../../../../.lake/packages .lake/packages
     }
   ```

3. Confirm the skeleton parses *with sorries*:
   ```
   lake build <covering_lean_file_module>
   ```
   The build should succeed with "declaration uses sorry" warnings only.
   If parse-level errors exist, fix them first via direct edit (do not
   delegate); then re-confirm.

4. Read `plan.md`. Extract the theorem dependency graph and per-theorem
   strategy. Build an internal queue of `(theorem_name, todo_marker,
   suggested_tactic, dependency_list)` tuples.

5. Update `state.yaml`: set `status: formalization`, `phase: stage-4-formalization`,
   add `formalization_started_at: <ISO date>`.

6. Append a new session header to `progress.md`:
   ```
   ## Session N (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM)
   - Starting sorries: <count>
   - Budget: 8h, per-sorry 15min autoprove + 25min sorry-filler-deep
   - Plan order: T1, T2, T3, ...
   ```

### Step 1 — Proof loop

Process sorries in **dependency order** from `plan.md`. For each:

1. **Pre-check.** Run `mcp__lean-lsp__lean_goal` (if available) on the
   sorry's position to confirm the residual goal matches what `plan.md`
   describes. If the goal looks materially different, log this as a
   spec-divergence note in `progress.md` and continue anyway.

2. **First attempt — `lean4:autoprove`.** Spawn the subagent with:
   - The exact theorem name and file path
   - The `plan.md` proof sketch for this theorem as a starting hint
   - The dependency list (which already-closed lemmas it can use)
   - Iteration budget: 5 cycles
   - Time budget: 15 minutes

   ```
   Agent({
     description: "Close <theorem-name>",
     subagent_type: "lean4:autoprove",
     prompt: "Close the sorry in <file>:<line> for theorem <name>.
              Suggested approach from plan.md: <sketch>.
              Available lemmas: <dependencies>.
              Hard stop at 5 cycles or 15 minutes.
              Report: closed | partial(<residual>) | no-progress."
   })
   ```

3. **Outcome dispatch:**
   - **`closed`:** Read the file to see what the agent committed. Run
     `lake build <module>` to confirm. If clean, log success in
     `progress.md` ("T1 closed via decide+fin_cases"). Move to next sorry.
   - **`partial`:** Try one more `lean4:autoprove` cycle with the residual
     state as context. If still partial after that, escalate.
   - **`no-progress` or "second `partial`":** Escalate to
     `lean4:sorry-filler-deep` with the same context plus an explicit ask
     to refactor the proof if needed.

4. **Escalation — `lean4:sorry-filler-deep`.** Budget: 25 minutes, 3 cycles.
   - **Closed:** great, log and move on.
   - **Not closed:** rewrite the sorry as `BLOCKED(<id>-T<n>): <reason>`,
     append a detailed write-up in `progress.md` with what was tried.

5. **After each closed sorry:** run a `lake build <module>` smoke check.
   If it fails, the last change introduced a regression — undo via git or
   spawn `lean4:proof-repair` to fix.

6. **Commit cadence:** after every **3 closed sorries** (or every 5 attempts
   regardless of outcome), commit. The Lean file and the progress log live
   in different repos: commit the Lean changes on the QECLean worktree
   branch, and the attempt metadata in qec-lab:
   ```bash
   # in the QECLean worktree:
   git add <file>
   git commit -m "wip(stage-4/<id>): close T<a>, T<b>, T<c> (N/22 sorries)"
   # in qec-lab:
   git add pipeline/attempts/<id>/progress.md
   git commit -m "wip(stage-4/<id>): progress log"
   ```
   At the end of the session, commit any remaining changes with the final
   tally in the message.

### Step 2 — Final pass

Once the proof loop exits (all sorries processed or 8-hour cap hit):

1. **`lean4:proof-golfer` on closed proofs only.** Spawn with the list of
   theorems just closed. Time budget: 30 minutes total. Goal: 20-30% size
   reduction, no semantic change.

2. **`lake build`** for the whole module. Must be clean (warnings only for
   any remaining `BLOCKED` sorries).

3. **`lean4:review` (read-only).** Final read-over of the file. Time budget:
   10 minutes. Capture review notes in `progress.md`.

4. **Update `state.yaml`:**
   - If zero `BLOCKED` markers and `lake build` clean → `status: pr-ready`.
   - If `BLOCKED` markers remain → `status: formalization-blocked`,
     `blocked_count: <N>`.
   - Add `formalization_completed_at: <ISO date>`.

5. **Write `result.md`** in `pipeline/attempts/<id>/`. Schema:

   ```markdown
   # Result: <code_id>

   ## Status
   <pr-ready | formalization-blocked>

   ## Sorries closed
   <N of M>. List each by theorem name with the tactic that closed it.

   ## Blocked sorries
   For each: theorem name, attempted approaches, hypothesized blocker
   (mathlib gap? repo gap? proof technique not yet known?).

   ## Lines of Lean produced
   <approx LoC>; original estimate was <X>.

   ## Time spent
   <hours by phase>.

   ## Patterns discovered
   Anything worth adding to CLAUDE.md for future runs. E.g.:
   - "The k≥2 `logical_commute_cross` packaging uses pattern Y"
   - "decide on small Fin n was significantly faster than fin_cases"
   - "<mathlib lemma X> is the canonical way to do <thing>"

   ## Suggested follow-ups
   - <follow-up 1, e.g. "lift `distance_two_from_full_X_full_Z` into Core/ for reuse">
   - <follow-up 2>
   ```

6. **Final commit** with the result.md and the closing tally.

7. **Print one-line summary** for the spawner:
   ```
   Stage 4 complete for <code_id>: <N>/<M> closed, <K> blocked, <L> LoC,
   status: <pr-ready | formalization-blocked>. Result at
   pipeline/attempts/<id>/result.md.
   ```

## Things to look out for

- **Don't fight the worktree.** If `lake build` is hanging, it's usually
  the workspace lock or a stale ilean. Run `bash scripts/prune-stale-ileans.sh`
  (in the QECLean checkout)
  before assuming the issue is logical. If mathlib symlink is broken,
  re-symlink per QECLean's CLAUDE.md.

- **Don't run two lake processes concurrently.** The MCP LSP shares the
  workspace lock with `lake build`. Per CLAUDE.md, pick one mode at a time.

- **Cascade failures.** If you close T_n but the file no longer builds,
  the issue is *probably* an ambiguous-overload or HMul-resolution issue
  the closing tactic introduced (see CLAUDE.md's "High-frequency mechanical
  fixes" section). Spawn `lean4:proof-repair` rather than reverting.

- **k ≥ 2 packaging.** The `gap_audit.md` for this attempt may flag
  ergonomic concerns about the `StabilizerCode.logical_commute_cross` field
  for k ≥ 2. If you hit issues there, the workaround is to use the
  explicit `Fin 2` case-split rather than the `Subsingleton.elim` shortcut
  that Steane7 uses. Don't refactor `Core/StabilizerCode.lean` unless the
  `gap_audit.md` explicitly suggests it.

- **Distance proofs by `decide`.** Small codes' distance proofs almost
  always reduce to `decide` or `native_decide` over a finite enumeration.
  If `lean4:autoprove` is exploring complex tactical structures for a
  distance proof, hint it explicitly toward `decide` via the prompt.

- **BLOCKED is OK.** Per the user's pipeline philosophy, partial / failed
  formalizations are first-class outputs. A `result.md` with 18/22 closed
  and 4 BLOCKED with detailed reasons is a perfectly acceptable Stage-4
  output — it surfaces real research / engineering follow-ups.

- **QECLean's CLAUDE.md is the single most-consulted file.** Whenever you
  discover
  an idiom or workaround during this attempt that future runs would
  benefit from, note it in `result.md`'s "Patterns discovered" section.
  The user batches these into QECLean CLAUDE.md updates periodically.

## Failure modes

- **Skeleton has parse errors.** Don't proceed to proof attempts.
  Fix the parse errors directly (Edit tool), confirm with `lake build`,
  then start the loop. If parse errors require non-trivial type-class
  surgery, mark the entire attempt as `formalization-blocked` with
  reason "skeleton parse failure" and surface it.

- **Mathlib symlink missing or broken.** Re-symlink per QECLean's CLAUDE.md. If
  the `diff lake-manifest.json ../../../lake-manifest.json` fails, the
  worktree has a different mathlib pin — escalate to human (do **not**
  run `lake exe cache get` or `lake update` without explicit approval).

- **Build flakes / `lake build` hangs.** Run
  `bash scripts/prune-stale-ileans.sh` (in the QECLean checkout), try once
  more, then escalate.

- **All `lean4:*` subagent calls return no-progress.** Likely a fundamental
  spec issue. Re-read `informal_spec.md` against the file's actual
  theorem statements — they may have drifted (e.g., wrong logical operator,
  off-by-one in qubit indexing). Surface this as a spec-correction request
  rather than continuing to try proofs that can't succeed.
