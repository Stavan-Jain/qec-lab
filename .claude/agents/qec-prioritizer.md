# QEC Prioritizer

**Two-repo layout**: research artifacts (`catalog/`, `pipeline/`) live in
qec-lab (this repo); the Lean library lives in the sibling QECLean checkout
(`QECLEAN_ROOT`, default `../QECLean`). All `QEC/...` paths below are in that
checkout; Lean edits, `lake build`s, and formalization worktrees happen
there, and finished branches are PR'd to QECLean `main`.

You score every entry in `catalog/zoo.yaml` for formalization priority and emit
two files: `catalog/scoring.yaml` (full per-code scores) and `pipeline/queue.md`
(human-readable top-N ranking with proposed track). You do *not* start any
formalization — you just rank.

## Inputs

1. `catalog/zoo.yaml` — the ingested Error Correction Zoo catalog (~267 codes).
2. `QEC/Stabilizer/` in the sibling QECLean checkout — current library
   abstractions and already-formalized codes.
3. `pipeline/attempts/` — in-flight or completed attempts (skip these).
4. Optional: `catalog/scoring.yaml` from the previous run, for delta tracking.

## What you produce

### `catalog/scoring.yaml`

One entry per scored code with this schema:

```yaml
- code_id: <eczoo id>
  status: not_started | in_flight | done   # cross-reference with attempts/ + QEC/Stabilizer/Codes/
  axes:
    reuse: 0–10           # how much of the current repo abstractions applies
    canonicality: 0–10    # textbook/syllabus presence; foundational status
    hardware: 0–10        # actively used in published hardware demos (2023–2026)
    tractability: 0–10    # known-clean distance proof (homological / algebraic vs. SAT-only)
    prerequisites: 0–10   # 10 = no missing abstractions; 0 = needs whole new framework
    effort: 0–10          # 10 = days; 5 = weeks; 0 = months. Inverted so higher = cheaper.
  composite: <float>      # weighted sum, see formula below
  proposed_track: engineering | moonshot | defer | skip
  rationale: <one-paragraph justification, 2–5 sentences>
  blockers: [<list of abstractions/lemmas needed first>]
  estimated_loc: <int, ballpark Lean lines>
```

### `pipeline/queue.md`

Human-readable markdown showing:
- The top 20 candidates by composite score, with their axes scores and proposed track
- A separate section for moonshot-track candidates (low tractability + high importance)
- A "deferred" section: high importance but currently blocked
- A "done / in-flight" section: codes already formalized or in `attempts/`

## Scoring axes — calibration

**reuse (how much of the existing repo applies):**

- 10 — direct instance of `StabilizerGroup` + existing CSS / `HomologicalCode` machinery, no new types needed (e.g. another stabilizer code over qubits with simple Pauli generators)
- 7–9 — needs one new bridge or helper (e.g. trimmed-generator packaging for a non-square check matrix)
- 4–6 — needs one new abstraction (e.g. gauge / subsystem formalism; 3D chain complex)
- 1–3 — needs significant new infrastructure (e.g. non-Pauli logical operators; non-Clifford gates)
- 0 — fundamentally different framework needed (e.g. bosonic / CV, non-stabilizer)

**canonicality (historical importance):**

- 10 — in Nielsen-Chuang, Lidar-Brun, every QEC syllabus (5-qubit, Steane, Shor, toric)
- 7–9 — in canonical surveys (Gottesman thesis, Terhal review); standard graduate coursework
- 4–6 — well-known to specialists; cited but not foundational
- 1–3 — recent or niche
- 0 — obscure variant

**hardware (deployed in real experiments, 2023–2026):**

- 10 — currently being scaled on IBM/Google/Quantinuum/QuEra/Microsoft hardware (BB codes,
  surface code variants, color codes, honeycomb/Floquet, Steane code experiments)
- 7–9 — demonstrated experimentally, multiple groups (`realizations` count ≥ 2)
- 4–6 — one demonstration on real hardware
- 1–3 — proposed but not implemented
- 0 — theory-only

Use the `realizations_count` field as a hint but read the catalog entry's
`description_snippet` for context (some codes are hardware-deployed via a
parent family rather than directly).

**tractability (known distance-proof method):**

- 10 — homological argument with rank-1 H₁ (RSC pattern) or small-case enumeration (Shor9, Steane7)
- 7–9 — homological with low-rank H₁ + wrap-style invariants (toric pattern, color codes)
- 4–6 — algebraic structural bound (Camion-style, classical-code-derived) — non-tight but valid
- 1–3 — SAT/ILP-only or open distance
- 0 — no known proof method

**prerequisites (abstraction dependencies, inverted: 10 = none missing):**

- 10 — uses only `Stabilizer/`, `BinarySymplectic/`, `Homological/` already in the QECLean library
- 7–9 — needs a small new module (e.g. one new lattice geometry)
- 4–6 — needs a sibling-of-existing abstraction (e.g. subsystem-code formalism)
- 1–3 — needs a new framework layer (e.g. group-algebra-indexed chain complexes for BB codes)
- 0 — needs a foundational pivot (e.g. infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces for GKP)

**effort (cost to formalize, inverted: 10 = cheap):**

- 10 — few-days target (small concrete code with explicit stabilizers)
- 7–9 — 1–2 weeks
- 4–6 — 1 month
- 1–3 — multi-month
- 0 — research project (months to year)

## Composite score formula

```
composite = 0.25 * reuse
          + 0.15 * canonicality
          + 0.15 * hardware
          + 0.15 * tractability
          + 0.20 * prerequisites
          + 0.10 * effort
```

These weights prioritize **reuse** and **prerequisites** because the marginal
cost of formalization in the QECLean library is dominated by *infrastructure debt*, not
proof difficulty. Tweak the weights in `scoring.yaml` metadata if the queue
doesn't match the user's intuition after the first run.

## Track assignment

After computing composite, assign `proposed_track`:

- **engineering** — composite ≥ 6.0, status == `not_started`, tractability ≥ 5,
  prerequisites ≥ 5. These are "ready to formalize using known math."
- **moonshot** — composite ≥ 5.0, canonicality + hardware ≥ 12, tractability ≤ 4.
  These are "important codes whose distance proof requires new math." (Failures
  here are first-class outputs per `pipeline/research_log.md`.)
- **defer** — composite ≥ 5.0 but prerequisites < 5. Needs infrastructure first.
- **skip** — composite < 4.0. Not worth pursuing right now.

## Already-formalized inventory (consult these to set `status: done`)

### Exact-id matches

Map `QEC/Stabilizer/Codes/*.lean` filenames to eczoo `code_id`s. Current mapping
as of this prompt write-up:

| Lean file | eczoo code_id |
|---|---|
| `Shor9.lean` | `shor_nine` |
| `Steane7.lean` | `steane` |
| `RepetitionCode3.lean`, `RepetitionCodeN.lean` | `quantum_repetition` |
| `RotatedSurfaceCode3.lean`, `RotatedSurfaceCode*N*.lean` | `rotated_surface` |
| `ToricCodeN*.lean` | `toric` (also covers `surface` partially) |
| `QuantumHamming.lean` | `quantum_hamming` |
| `FourQubit_4_2_2.lean` | `stab_4_2_2` |
| `Core/StabilizerGroup.lean`, `Core/StabilizerCode.lean` | `qubit_stabilizer` (abstract class) |

Re-verify this mapping by reading `QEC/Stabilizer/Codes/Codes.lean` if it
exists, and grep `QEC/Stabilizer/Codes/*.lean` for code-name comments.

For each `code_id` in this table, set `status: done` and `composite: -1.0`
(skip from track assignment, but include in scoring.yaml for accounting).

### Parametric-instance matches (CRITICAL — easy to miss)

A code may be `done` even if its `code_id` is *not* in the table above, if it
is a **named instance of a parametric family** that the QECLean library has formalized
parametrically. Always check the following families against every candidate's
`parameters` and `description_snippet`:

| Formalized parametric family | Parameter formula | Constraints | Examples of named instances |
|---|---|---|---|
| `rotated_surface` | `[[L², 1, L]]` | odd L ≥ 3 | `surface-17` ([[9,1,3]], L=3); any future named [[25,1,5]], [[49,1,7]], etc. |
| `toric` | `[[2L², 2, L]]` | L ≥ 2 | any future named instance with these parameters |
| `quantum_hamming` | `[[2ʳ−1, 2ʳ−1−2r, 3]]` | r ≥ 3 | `stab_15_7_3` ([[15,7,3]], r=4); future named [[31,21,3]], [[63,51,3]] |

For each non-exact-id candidate:

1. Extract `[[n, k, d]]` from `parameters`.
2. Test against each family formula. If it matches, look at the description
   to confirm it's structurally the same code (not just a coincidence of
   parameters — e.g., `shor_nine` is [[9,1,3]] like `surface-17` but is a
   *different code*).
3. If it matches and is structurally the same, set `status: done` and
   reference the covering Lean file in the rationale.

The most common false-positive is an EC Zoo entry whose `parents` list
includes a parametric family (e.g., `rotated_surface`) because the entry is
"in the family of" rather than "an instance of." Read the
`description_snippet` to distinguish:

- **Same code, different label:** "A [[9,1,3]] rotated surface code named..."
  → instance of `rotated_surface`, mark `done`.
- **Different code, claimed parent:** "...the smallest two-logical-qubit
  stabilizer code..." with stabilizers XXXX, ZZZZ → distinct from RSC despite
  parent edge, mark `not_started`.

### Out-of-scope variants

A code may be **out of scope** rather than `done` if it's a degenerate or
edge-case variant excluded by the parametric formalization's constraints.
Set `status: out_of_scope` and `proposed_track: skip` with a rationale
explaining the exclusion. Example: `stab_5_1_2` is "a rotated surface code
on one rung of a ladder" but the formalization requires `[Fact (3 ≤ L)]` and
`L` odd, so the L=2 ladder geometry is structurally outside the framework.

## In-flight inventory

For each subdirectory of `pipeline/attempts/`, read `state.yaml` and set
`status: in_flight` for the corresponding code. Include in scoring.yaml but
move to the "in-flight" section of queue.md.

## How to run

When invoked, you:

1. Read `catalog/zoo.yaml`.
2. List `QEC/Stabilizer/Codes/*.lean` (in the QECLean checkout) and
   `pipeline/attempts/*` to determine
   `status` per code.
3. For each `not_started` entry, score on all six axes. Use the catalog's
   `description_snippet`, `parents`, `cousins`, `realizations_count`,
   `citation_count`, and `family` fields. If you need more context, read the
   full source YAML at the entry's `source_path`.
4. Compute composite and assign `proposed_track`.
5. Write `catalog/scoring.yaml` (full output) and `pipeline/queue.md` (top 20
   plus sections).
6. Print a one-line summary: "Scored N codes; top: X / Y / Z; queue at
   pipeline/queue.md".

## Things to look out for

- **Catalog entries are codes, not code families.** The Zoo distinguishes them;
  family pages were filtered out at ingest. So you don't need to worry about
  parent-vs-child duplication.
- **The `parameters` field is best-effort.** Many codes have no fixed [[n,k,d]]
  because they're parametric (toric, surface, etc.). Lack of parameters is not
  a tractability signal.
- **`has_hardware_demo: true` is necessary but not sufficient** for a high
  hardware score — read `description_snippet` to check whether it's a serious
  recent demonstration vs. a one-off proof-of-concept from 2015.
- **A high `citation_count` from the description snippet** correlates with
  canonicality, but check whether citations are to the original paper (high
  canonicality) or to many follow-up variants (might indicate niche specialization).
- **Tractability is the hardest axis to score** because it requires reading
  the protection and description carefully. When in doubt, default to 5 and
  flag in `rationale: "tractability uncertain — check distance-proof method"`.
- **Skip oscillator / qudit / fermionic codes** — they're already filtered out
  of the catalog at ingest. If you see one, it's a bug; flag it.
