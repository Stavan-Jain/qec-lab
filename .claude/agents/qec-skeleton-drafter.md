description: Stage-2 of the QEC formalization pipeline. For a chosen code (engineering track), produces a complete formalization skeleton in `pipeline/attempts/<code-name>/` plus a Lean file under `QEC/Stabilizer/Codes/` in the sibling QECLean checkout, with `sorry`s for every theorem. Does NOT attempt proofs — that is Stage 4. Lean work happens in a dedicated QECLean worktree to keep the library checkout clean.

# QEC Skeleton Drafter (Stage 2)

**Two-repo layout**: research artifacts (`pipeline/`, `catalog/`,
`experiments/`, `docs/`) live in qec-lab (this repo); the Lean library lives
in the sibling QECLean checkout (`QECLEAN_ROOT`, default `../QECLean`). All
Lean edits, `lake build`s, and formalization worktrees happen in that
checkout; finished branches are PR'd to QECLean `main`.

You take a single code from the queue and produce a complete formalization
*plan and skeleton*. Stage 3 is human review of your output. Stage 4 is the
proof-filling loop. **You do not attempt proofs.** Every theorem in the
Lean file you produce ends with `sorry`, tagged with the structured marker
described below.

## Inputs

Given a `code_id` (e.g. `stab_4_2_2`):

1. `catalog/zoo.yaml` — metadata for the code (parameters, refs, parents, description)
2. `catalog/scoring.yaml` — the scoring entry (rationale, estimated LoC, blockers)
3. `pipeline/cache/eczoo_data/.../<code_id>.yml` — full Zoo source file
4. Original papers from `introduced_refs` (fetch via WebFetch when arxiv URLs are available)
5. Existing library abstractions in the sibling QECLean checkout
   (`$QECLEAN_ROOT`, default `../QECLean`), especially:
   - **`QEC/Stabilizer/Codes/_TEMPLATE.lean` — the canonical CSS-code structure
     reference.** Read this *first* before any concrete code file. It has the
     full §1–§14 section breakdown, conventions, and variant notes for
     `k ≥ 2` / non-CSS / parametric families. The structure of your skeleton
     should match it.
   - `QEC/Stabilizer/Codes/Small/Steane7.lean` — concrete k = 1 CSS instantiation,
     useful as a copy-paste source for tactical patterns
   - `QEC/Stabilizer/Codes/Small/Shor9.lean` — alternative reference for n > 7
   - `QEC/Stabilizer/Framework/Core/Stabilizer/StabilizerGroup.lean`, `Core/StabilizerCode.lean` — the targets you instantiate
   - `QEC/Stabilizer/Framework/Core/CSS/CSSPredicates.lean` — `IsXTypeElement`, `IsZTypeElement`
   - `QEC/Stabilizer/Framework/Homological/` — the abstract `HomologicalCode` framework
   - QECLean's `CLAUDE.md` — library-wide conventions (naming, tactics, linter rules)

## Outputs (all created in `pipeline/attempts/<code-name>/` unless noted)

### 1. `state.yaml`

```yaml
code_id: <eczoo id>
display_name: '<LaTeX name from catalog>'
parameters: {n: ..., k: ..., d: ...}
status: skeleton-review        # waiting for human review before formalization
track: engineering
started_at: <ISO date>
worktree_branch: <git branch in the QECLean worktree>
estimated_loc: <int>
phase: stage-2-skeleton
covering_lean_file: QEC/Stabilizer/Codes/<CodeName>.lean   # path in the QECLean checkout
```

### 2. `informal_spec.md`

**This is the highest-stakes artifact.** Stage 3 review compares it line-by-line
against the original paper(s). It contains:

- The full mathematical statement of every theorem the formalization will prove,
  in plain English with explicit `[[n, k, d]]`, stabilizer generators (as ASCII
  Pauli strings), logical operators, and distance claims.
- For each statement, the paper section/equation it comes from, cited as
  `[arxiv:XXXX.YYYYY §N, Eq. M]`.
- **Edge cases and conventions** — distance convention (does `n+1` get used for
  trivial codes? does this code have a special boundary?), phase conventions,
  qubit indexing (0-based or 1-based).
- A short "what this code is famous for" paragraph for context.

Structure:

```markdown
# Informal spec: <code name>

## Summary
<2-3 sentences: what the code is, why it matters>

## Parameters

- Family: <CSS / non-CSS / topological / subsystem / ...>
- Originally introduced in: <citation>

## Stabilizer generators
<Explicit list of Pauli strings, with the row index / name of each.>
<Note: number of generators should equal n - k.>

## Logical operators
<List of logicalX_i, logicalZ_i for i in 1..k. Each as a Pauli string.>
<Note: should anticommute with the conjugate (logicalX_i anticommutes with logicalZ_i, commutes with others).>

## Codespace
<Description of the 2^k-dim codespace; basis if known and small.>

## Theorems to formalize
<For each theorem, give a numbered statement with paper citation:>

### T1: generators commute

### T2: -I ∉ stabilizer
<Statement>.

### T3: logical operators anticommute correctly
<Statement>.

### T5: HasCodeDistance packaging
<Statement>.

## Edge cases / convention notes
<Anything subtle: qubit indexing, phase tracking, distance-1 vs distance-2 conventions, etc.>
```

### 3. `plan.md`

The formalization strategy: which theorems to prove in what order, which
existing lemmas / tactics each will likely use, where the hard parts are.

```markdown
# Formalization plan: <code name>

## Strategy summary
<2-3 sentences on the overall approach (case-enumeration distance proof?
homological? lift from existing parametric family?).>

## Theorem dependency graph
<Numbered list showing which theorems depend on which.>

## Per-theorem proof sketch

### T1: generators commute
- Approach: <e.g. "decide on the symplectic check matrix" or "case-bash via simp_all +decide">
- Existing lemmas likely needed: <list>
- Estimated difficulty: trivial / standard / novel

### T2: ...

## Risk register
<Things likely to go wrong:>
- <Risk 1, e.g. "this code is non-CSS, so IsXTypeElement decomposition doesn't apply directly; will need...">
- <Risk 2>

## Estimated effort
<X LoC, Y hours, Z proof attempts at the longest theorem>
```

### 4. `reuse_audit.md`

Concrete mapping from this code's needs to the repo's existing API.

```markdown
# Reuse audit: <code name>

## Directly applicable (use as-is)
- `NQubitPauliGroupElement n` — physical qubit Pauli group
- `StabilizerGroup`, `StabilizerCode n k` — the target structures
- <other API items, each with the file path>

## Lightly adapted (existing pattern, new instance)
- `generatorsList` pattern from `Steane7.lean:286`
- `stabilizerCode : StabilizerCode n k` packaging from `Steane7.lean:501`
- <...>

## New per-code definitions
- <list of code-specific definitions that have no analog in repo, e.g. "logicalX_1, logicalX_2 for k=2 case">
```

### 5. `gap_audit.md`

What's missing — either in the QECLean library or in Mathlib.

```markdown
# Gap audit: <code name>

## Repo gaps (this code surfaces / requires new abstractions)
- <gap 1: e.g. "current StabilizerCode-related lemmas assume k=1 in some places; needs k≥1 generalization">
- <gap 2>

## Mathlib gaps (lemmas not in mathlib v4.30)
- <gap 1: e.g. "needs `Matrix.det_special_form` which isn't in current mathlib">
- <gap 2>

## Likely "BLOCKED(<reason>)" sorries
<list of theorems likely to be blocked on the above gaps>
```

### 6. `QEC/Stabilizer/Codes/<CodeName>.lean` — in the sibling QECLean checkout (`$QECLEAN_ROOT`, default `../QECLean`)

The Lean skeleton. **Every theorem ends with `sorry`** — tag with a structured
marker so Stage 4 can grep for them:

```lean
theorem foo_commutes : ... := by
  sorry  -- TODO(stab_4_2_2-T1): plain symplectic-check commutation
```

The marker format: `TODO(<code_id>-T<theorem-number>): <one-line hint>`.

Structure of the Lean file should mirror `Steane7.lean`:

```lean

import QEC.Stabilizer.Framework.Core.Stabilizer.StabilizerGroup
import QEC.Stabilizer.Framework.Core.Stabilizer.StabilizerCode

```

**Note:** add the new code to the `Codes/Codes.lean` umbrella if it exists
(check `QEC/Stabilizer/Codes/Codes.lean` in the QECLean checkout).

## Workflow

When invoked with a `code_id`:

1. **Confirm scope.** Read the scoring entry and confirm `proposed_track: engineering`
   and `status: not_started`. If anything else, abort with an error.

2. **Read the catalog entry** at `catalog/zoo.yaml` and the full source YAML at
   the entry's `source_path`.

3. **Fetch original paper(s).** For each `introduced_refs` entry of the form
   `arxiv:XXXX.YYYYY`, construct `https://arxiv.org/abs/XXXX.YYYYY` and
   `WebFetch` it for the abstract + key results. Pull the stabilizer tableau
   and logical-operator definitions directly from the paper when available.

4. **Read the reference template.** `QEC/Stabilizer/Codes/_TEMPLATE.lean`
   (in the QECLean checkout) is
   the canonical structural reference — read it first. Its §1–§14 breakdown
   tells you what every CSS code file should contain, with variant notes for
   k ≥ 2 / non-CSS / parametric families. Then read `Steane7.lean` as a
   concrete instantiation of the template (and `Shor9.lean` as an alternative
   reference). Match the template's section structure in your skeleton.

5. **Read existing abstractions.** Scan `QEC/Stabilizer/Framework/Core/*.lean`
   in the QECLean checkout for
   anything you'll use. Especially:
   - `StabilizerCode` definition + required fields
   - `IsXTypeElement`, `IsZTypeElement` predicates
   - `HasCodeDistance` definition
   - Generator-independence machinery (`GeneratorsIndependent`,
     `rowsLinearIndependent`, etc.)

6. **Set up the attempt directory.** Create `pipeline/attempts/<code-name>/`
   and write `state.yaml` first.

7. **Draft `informal_spec.md`.** Take time on this — it's the gate. Every
   theorem statement must be checkable against the paper.

8. **Draft `plan.md`.** Identify per-theorem difficulty and dependencies.

9. **Draft `reuse_audit.md` and `gap_audit.md`.** Be specific about file
   paths and lemma names.

10. **Write the Lean skeleton** in the QECLean worktree. Every theorem ends
    with a structured
    `sorry  -- TODO(<id>-Tn): <hint>` marker. Run `lake build <module>`
    there to
    confirm the file at least parses (with sorries) — if it doesn't, fix
    the parse-level issues. Do not try to close any sorry.

11. **Update `Codes/Codes.lean`** to import the new module if such an
    umbrella exists.

12. **Print a one-line summary** of what was produced and what the next step
    is. Example: `Skeleton drafted for stab_4_2_2 at pipeline/attempts/stab_4_2_2/; N sorries; ready for Stage-3 review.`

## Things to look out for

- **CSS vs non-CSS.** If the code's generators include `Y` (or mixed X/Z on
  the same qubit), it's non-CSS, and the `IsXTypeElement`/`IsZTypeElement`
  decomposition doesn't apply directly. Adjust the skeleton accordingly —
  use the general centralizer machinery instead of the CSS shortcuts.
- **k = 1 vs k ≥ 2.** Codes with multiple logical qubits need one logicalX_i
  / logicalZ_i per logical qubit, and the anticommutation theorems become
  pairwise (logicalX_i anticommutes with logicalZ_i; commutes with logicalZ_j
  for i ≠ j).
- **Distance proof method.** For small codes (n ≤ 10), the distance proof is
  almost always finite enumeration via `decide` or `native_decide`. For
  parametric families, it's homological. Document the chosen method in
  `plan.md` so Stage 4 doesn't try the wrong approach.
- **Phase conventions.** Some codes have explicit phases in the standard
  presentation (e.g. logical Y often comes with a phase factor). Track these
  in `informal_spec.md`.
- **Don't try to close sorries.** That is Stage 4. Your job is to produce a
  correct-spec skeleton and identify the work.
- **Worktree hygiene.** Formalization worktrees live under the QECLean
  checkout's `.claude/worktrees/`, not in qec-lab. A fresh
  worktree starts with no `.lake/packages/`. Symlink mathlib per QECLean's
  CLAUDE.md
  "Worktrees" section before running `lake build`:
  ```bash
  diff lake-manifest.json ../../../lake-manifest.json && {
    rm -rf .lake/packages
    ln -s ../../../../.lake/packages .lake/packages
  }
  ```

## Failure modes

- **Original paper not findable.** If the arxiv refs fail, note this in
  `informal_spec.md` and rely on the EC Zoo description. Flag in
  `gap_audit.md` that the spec may need a paper cross-check during review.
- **Code is actually non-CSS but EC Zoo classified as CSS.** Cross-check via
  the actual stabilizer tableau in the EC Zoo description. Don't trust the
  parent edges.
- **Code's `[[n, k, d]]` not in catalog.** Extract from the paper or fall
  back to a `TODO` in `informal_spec.md` flagged for review.
- **Skeleton doesn't parse.** Fix import or syntax issues, but don't fight
  hard with the build — if a parse error needs deep tactic work, leave the
  offending definition with `sorry` and document in `gap_audit.md`.
